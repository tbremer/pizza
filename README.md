## sauce

ingredients

- 1 can Cento San Marzano tomatoes
- Cento tomato paste (to taste)
- salt
- pepper
- oregano
- garlic
- olive oil

stick blend the entire can of tomatoes

add olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano & garlic (can be minced, powdered, whatever) to taste

store in a jar in the fridge overnight, you _can_ use it immediately, but it's much better the next day

## cheese

- low moisture whole milk mozzarella
- shredded parmesan
- (optional) asiago, fontina, provelone, etc

as long as most of the cheese is mozz, you can do whatever you like here

try to keep the ratio of cheese to sauce 1:1

# step by step

take the dough out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature (covered)

preheat oven as hot as it will go with a pizza steel inside, the longer the better

using your fingertips gently press a circle into the dough leaving 1" of the edge untouched (for the crust)

stretch the dough (using your knuckles) into a 12" circle, avoid touching the edge too much, be gentle!

put some flour and/or cornmeal onto a pizza peel and lay the dough on it

scooping from the top of the jar with a spoon, add 2 or 3 spoonfuls of sauce to the dough

add cheese

slide the pizza onto your hot pizza steel and cook until the cheese is melted and the crust begins to speckle and brown, ideally 5-8 minutes, but don't be afraid to leave it in there a little longer.

rest for a minute or two and enjoy!
